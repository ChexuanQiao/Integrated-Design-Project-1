# Integrated-Design-Project

*This is a project for 2nd-year engineers in the University of Cambridge.*

Scenario:
Many robot applications require the ability of a robot to carry out a task to a high degree of precision. In this task
you are required to build a robot to demonstrate the collection, detection and delivery of blocks to a high degree of
precision in a structured environment.
Packages will be randomly positioned within a box, they must be sorted by colour and then accurately placed on the
target areas.
